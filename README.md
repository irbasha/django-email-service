Here, `py3env` is the name we are giving for the virtual environment. You can give the name of your choice.```virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 py3env```- Activate virtual environment.```source py3env/bin/activate```- Set Environment variables for django to read emailid and password for your gmail account. Our application will use your Gmail Account to trigger email id.```export EMAIL_USER='<YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT EMAIL ID HERE>' && export EMAIL_AUTH='<PASSWORD HERE>'```- Download or clone our repository `django-email-service` from github.- Unzip the Folder```unzip django-email-service```- Install Application requirements from `requirements.txt` available in django-email-service folder```pip install requirements.txt```- Move to EmailService directory which is our django project```cd EmailService/```- Create superuser account. Will be used for managing application and receive statistics report. Please provide valid username, emailid and a strong password. Same emailid will be used for generating statistics reports.```python manage.py createsuperuser```- Migrate and apply the fresh changes```python manage.py makemigrationspython manage.py migrate```- Run Django Server. If you are hosting the application on cloud machine make sure to the ip in django's `settings.py` file in ALLOWED_HOST list.```python manage.py runserver <ipaddress>:<port>```### Setting up ELK StackWe will use ELK Stack for managing our application's logs. By default logs are written to a log file in `/tmp/debug.log` location. With ELK implementation, logs will be sento Kibana over logstash and elasticsearch.The following steps are applicable only for Ubuntu/Debian flavours. For CentOS/RedHat please follow instructions from official website.[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana).- Install Java version 8 or above```sudo apt install default-jre```- Verify java version.```java --version```- Download and Install Public Signing Key```wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -```- Adding APT repository for ELK```sudo apt-get install apt-transport-httpsecho "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list```- Update System```sudo apt-get update```##### Elastic Search- Install Elastic Search```sudo apt-get install elasticsearch -y```- Start and enable elasticsearch service```systemctl daemon-reloadsystemctl enable elasticsearchsystemctl start elasticsearch```- Configure firewall to allow port access for elasticsearch```firewall-cmd --add-port=9200/tcpfirewall-cmd --add-port=9200/tcp --permanent ```- Verify logstash service is running properly```curl -X GET http://localhost:9200```- Output:```	{		"name" : "master",		"cluster_name" : "logmanager",		"cluster_uuid" : "sdcteHG4SUaZuM-Q8b6_Ag",		"version" : {			"number" : "2.4.2",			"build_hash" : "161c65a337d4b422ac0c805f284565cf2014bb84",			"build_timestamp" : "2016-11-17T11:51:03Z",			"build_snapshot" : false,			"lucene_version" : "5.5.2"		},		"tagline" : "You Know, for Search"	}```- For UI Install elasticsearch-head : https://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/##### Logstash- Install logstash```sudo apt-get install logstash -y```- Start and enable logstash service```systemctl daemon-reloadsystemctl start logstashsystemctl enable logstash```- Configure logstash. Create `logstash.conf` file under `/etc/logstash/` folder,```vim /etc/logstash/logstash.conf```- Add the following code to the file.```	input{	 file{	   path => "/tmp/debug.log"	 }	}	filter{	 grok{	   match => {"message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{LOGLEVEL:log-level} %{GREEDYDATA:message}"}	 }	 date {	   match => ["timestamp", "ISO8601"]	 }	}	output{	  elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] index => "index_name" }	  stdout { codec => rubydebug }	}```- Run logstash with logstash configuration.```./logstash -f /etc/logstash/logstash.conf --config.reload.automatic```##### Kibana- Install Kibana```sudo apt-get install kibana -y```- Start and Enable Kibana```systemctl daemon-reloadsystemctl start kibanasystemctl enable kibana```- Configure firewall to allow port access for Kibana```firewall-cmd --add-port=5601/tcpfirewall-cmd --add-port=5601/tcp --permanent```- Increase the file limits to get performance. Add below lines to /etc/security/limits.conf.```	*        soft   nofile   64000	*        hard   nofile   64000	root     soft   nofile   64000	root     hard   nofile   64000```- Reboot the system to take effect.```reboot```# Instructions for use- Access the application from browser with the url `http://localhost:8000`.
